## overview

hey what's up mtv welcome to my crib ✌️

it's easier for me to throw these configuration files on github, clone,
and install instead of losing them all the time when i reinstall a new distro
or hop across machines, so enjoy them!

here's what i'm currently running and what you'll probably need to install:

## current loadout

* **os**
  * [arch linux](https://archlinux.org/), btw
    * i use [trizen](https://github.com/trizen/trizen) as my package manager
  * macos (for work)
* **window manager(s)**
  * [kde](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/KDE) + [bismuth](https://github.com/Bismuth-Forge/bismuth) - tiling windows for kde! 
* **terminal emulator**
  * [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) - plays super nice with fonts!
* **text editor**
  * [doom emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) - hacking on mars has never been easier! i install `emacs-nativecomp` from the aur since it's recommended.

## things i usually install

* `bat`: backwards compatible `cat` alternative
* `lsd`: backwards compatible `ls` alternative
* `dog`: backwards compatible `dig` alternative
* `kitty`: modern terminal emulator
* `neovim`: but soon you'll meet my new new text editor!
* `tmatrix`: cool matrix thing it's cool ok
* `thefuck`: only human.
* `neofetch`: why elsse would i be running linux?

## license

they're under the [wtfpl](license.md), so do wtf you want with them. scripts i've found online should have a source attached or proper attribution. if they don't, [let me know](https://github.com/takouhai/dotfiles/issues/new).
