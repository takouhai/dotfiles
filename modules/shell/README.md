# shell

all of the programs i load into my shell through
[home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).
the main exception is kitty,
which is my terminal emulator.

let's be real, i don't use _all_ of these programs all the time.
however, i really like having them around since i go
"oh wow i really liked that program" and then i never
actually installed it and i don't remember what it was called
so that idea just goes off into the sea of lost memories.
so i just install whatever i see that looks cool
(and works decently well)
and i find i never use it i just remove it.
trust me, i don't understand me either.

if you want some real recommendations, check out the...

## hall of fame

these are programs you should definitely check out.
i use these almost every day. some are drop-in replacements
for old unix programs so you can add them as backwards
compatible shortcuts in your shell. check out my
[zsh config](../../programs/zsh/default.nix)
for some commands i can't live without and i've actually
hardcoded into my shell.
